## General Approach 

We first reviewed the technical requirements, necessary deliverables and sketched a wireframe to achieve our project tasks. We reached a consensus that it was important to continousluy clarify our project goals throughout the week to ensure that our project work remained aligned with initial premise. On Day 1, we listed the model we would need, their end points, and the relationship the tables would have to each other. We created a task list on Trello to visualize what we needed to do at stage of the process. Using the task list, we estimated the time it would take to acccomplish each task to prepare for unforeseen problems in our creative process. Below is a timeline of how we planned our project.


| Day         | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       | 6       | 7     |
|------------ |-------- |-------- |-------- |-------- |---------|---------|-------|
